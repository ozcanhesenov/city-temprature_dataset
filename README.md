Daily Temperature Descriptive Statistics

This project analyzes a dataset of daily temperature values using fundamental descriptive statistics and data visualization techniques.
It includes calculations such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, z-scores, and visual comparisons between the old and new datasets.

📌 Features

Data Cleaning – Removes missing or irrelevant values to ensure accurate analysis.

Descriptive Statistics – Calculates:

Mean (average)
Median (middle value)
Mode (most frequent value)
Standard Deviation (data spread)
Z-scores (standardized values)
Visualization – Compares old vs. new dataset using:
Histograms
